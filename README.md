  # Character Morph Mod

Ever wanted to look like the Legendary Dragon himself, or any other enemy? With this mod, you can!

  ## Features
 * Morph yourself into any normal sized enemy (apart from hidden characters like Akiyama, Majima and Guru)
 * Partly clientsided

 ## Questions

 ### Can I morph to Spoiled Brat, Derek, Shucky, etc..?
Currently, no. I need to edit the code to make it check if you're going to morph into one of those, and scale your character accordingly. Technically you COULD morph yourself into them, but it'll look stupid.
